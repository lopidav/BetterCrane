# BetterCrane
Stacklands mod. Improves crane functionality 
Features: 
- Sell and buy boxes are targetable so automatic selling and buying is possible (you can turn that off in config if you want)
-  The crane now targets the whole stack. For example: as long as the crane is pointing on the stove it'll put fish on top of it no matter how far the top of the stack is
-   Crane can take out cards from the boosters (you can turn that off in config if you want)
-   Crane can now move any player-draggable card type except for buildings (you can turn that off in config if you want)
 -   If a card is in the process of doing something it canâ€™t be moved by a crane (you can turn that off in config if you want)
-   Glue is now targetable    
-   Crane can take coins from the coin chest
-   More then 40 arrows can be drawn now
-   Fixed the bug when the crane is putting a card on some other card while that other card gets moved too and the first card is just dropped on the floor and it's a mess so i fixed it all good now very cool

Doesn't add any new cards.

I strongly recommend playing around with configs.
If you make all player-draggable cards cranable that cranes themselves would be moved by cranes.
And most of the stuff that isn't vanilla-like can be turned off.

Hope
